	Claim \textbf{because of} reason \textbf{based on} evidence
	\section{Claim}
	The solution to your research question. They are backed up with reason and evidence.\\
	The principle questions for any claim are
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			What kind of claim should I make? &\\
			\hline
			Is the claim specific? &\\
			\hline
			Will my readers think it is significant enough to need an argument supporting it? &\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Conceptual claim}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Does a thing exist? &\\
			\hline
			How should we characterise it? &\\
			\hline
			How did it get this way?&\\
			\hline
			Moral judgement?&\\
			\hline
			What can/should be done about it?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Practical claims}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Why your solution is feasible? &\\
			\hline
			Why it costs less?&\\
			\hline
			Why it will not create a bigger problem?&\\
			\hline
			Why it is faster/cheaper?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Evaluation}
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Is my claim... &\\
			\hline
			Specific?&\\
			\hline
			Is the logic explicit?&\\
			\hline
			Acknowledge the views of critics?&\\
			\hline
			Significant? (test by reversing the claim)&\\
			\hline
			Acknowledge limiting conditions&\\
			\hline
			Use hedges to limit certainty&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\section{Reason}
	An assertion that supports the claim
	\section{Evidence}
	Data deployed to support a reason 
	\section{Acknowledge and Response}
	What critiques will my claim have ahead of time?
	\section{Warrant}
	Reference general principles that link a particular claim and reason together. 
	A general circumstance predictably leads to a general circumstance. The general circumstance implies a specific circumstance. The specific circumstance lets us infer the specific consequence. Warrants are used to justify the linking of claim and reason, or explain a fields way of reasoning.

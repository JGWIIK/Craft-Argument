	Claim \textbf{because of} reason \textbf{based on} evidence
	\section{Claim}
	The solution to your research question. They are backed up with reason and evidence.\\
	The principle questions for any claim are
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			What kind of claim should I make? &\\
			\hline
			Is the claim specific? &\\
			\hline
			Will my readers think it is significant enough to need an argument supporting it? &\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Conceptual claim}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Does a thing exist? &\\
			\hline
			How should we characterise it? &\\
			\hline
			How did it get this way?&\\
			\hline
			Moral judgement?&\\
			\hline
			What can/should be done about it?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Practical claims}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Why your solution is feasible? &\\
			\hline
			Why it costs less?&\\
			\hline
			Why it will not create a bigger problem?&\\
			\hline
			Why it is faster/cheaper?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\subsection{Evaluation}
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Is my claim... &\\
			\hline
			Specific?&\\
			\hline
			Is the logic explicit?&\\
			\hline
			Acknowledge the views of critics?&\\
			\hline
			Significant? (test by reversing the claim)&\\
			\hline
			Acknowledge limiting conditions&\\
			\hline
			Use hedges to limit certainty&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\section{Reason}
	An assertion that supports the claim. 
	Storyboard reasons and evidence for your claim
	\section{Evidence}
	Data deployed to support a reason.	Assessing evidence
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Is the evidence...&\\
			\hline
			Reported accurately?&\\
			\hline
			Precise?&\\
			\hline
			sufficient and representative?&\\
			\hline
			Weighed appropriately to their authority? &\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\section{Acknowledge and Response}
	What critiques will my claim have ahead of time? Challenges are either intrinsic (clarity of claim, relevance of reason, or quality of evidence), or extrinsic (alternative framings, or overlooked evidence). Testing questions for argument
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Why do I think there is a problem at all?&\\
			\hline
			Have I properly defined the problem &\\
			\hline
			Is the solution practical or conceptual?&\\
			\hline
			Is the claim too strong?&\\
			\hline
			Why is my solution better than others?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Testing questions for evidence
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Different sort of evidence?&\\
			\hline
			Inaccurate evidence?&\\
			\hline
			Imprecise?&\\
			\hline
			Isn't current?&\\
			\hline
			Isn't representative&\\
			\hline
			Isn't authoritative?&\\
			\hline
			Insufficient?&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Include your considerations of alternatives in your argument.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Charges of weakness&\\
			\hline
			Alternative lines of argument&\\
			\hline
			Alternative conclusions&\\
			\hline
			Alternative evidence&\\
			\hline
			Important counterexamples&\\
			\hline
			Additional causes&\\
			\hline
			Alternative categories&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Acknowledge flaws in argument. Unanswerable questions. Challenge and respond to them all.
	\section{Warrant}
	Reference general principles that link a particular claim and reason together. 
	A general circumstance predictably leads to a general circumstance. The general circumstance implies a specific circumstance. The specific circumstance lets us infer the specific consequence. Warrants are used to justify the linking of claim and reason, or explain a fields way of reasoning. 
	Testing warrants
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Is the warrant...&\\
			\hline
			Reasonable?&\\
			\hline
			Sufficiently limited?&\\
			\hline
			superior to competing warrants&\\
			\hline
			appropriate to the field&\\
			\hline
			covers the claim and reason&\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l |l|}
			\hline
			Use warrants&\\
			\hline
			Readers are outside the field&\\
			\hline
			Your reasons are new and controversial&\\
			\hline
			Readers will resist claim&\\
			\hline
